A collection of nodes.

<p>Systems within the engine access the components of entities via NodeLists. A NodeList contains
a node for each Entity in the engine that has all the components required by the node. To iterate
over a NodeList, start from the head and step to the next on each loop, until the returned value
is null.</p>

<p>for( var node : Node = nodeList.head; node; node = node.next )
{
  // do stuff
}</p>

<p>It is safe to remove items from a nodelist during the loop. When a Node is removed form the
NodeList it's previous and next properties still point to the nodes that were before and after
it in the NodeList just before it was removed.</p>

A signal that is dispatched whenever a node is added to the node list.

- nodeRemoved:

A signal that is dispatched whenever a node is removed from the node list.
